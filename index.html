    <h1>Hello Box!</h1>
    <p id="intro">I'm newish to the industry, and my first job after grad school was at an agency, which means that for the last year I've been working under NDA. I have a lot of awesome experience identifying, critiquing, and advising solutions to usability issues.... and I can't show you any of it. That's why I've made you a present: a mini-portfolio demonstrating what I could and will do for Box if I were part of your team!</p>
	<p id="signoff">Enjoy.</p>

			<h2>Problem: Confusing Login</h2>

			<p>Whenever I try to log into my Box account, I invariably click "sign up" by accident. The "Sign Up" button is where I expect the Log In link to be, as most websites place the login in the top right corner. The white arrow only reinforces my impulse.

			<h3>my Solution</h3>

			<p>I sacrificed the carousel image to place a static branding image on the left side of the page. Visual weight is given to Sign Up and See Plans (personal and business, respectively), immediately attracting new users' attention without confusing users who are trying to Log In. The new Log In button borrows the white arrow from before. If it is important to maintain the carousel content, the three boxes at the bottom can cycle, rather than the banner image.</p>

			<h2>Problem: Difficult to edit documents</h2>
			<p>how do I website</p>
			<h3>my Solution</h3>
			<img><a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=2608i01" target="_blank"><img src="http://i42.tinypic.com/2608i01.gif" border="0" alt="TinyPic"></a></img>
			<p>I pulled out some of the more commonly-used functions, such as comment, tags, and delete, and placed them in the document row for quick access. I removed the account information from right column, which would now be accessed from "Account" link. This allows the bulk of the page to be devoted to organizing and interacting with documents. I also added redundancy (for example, multiple ways to sort and add tags). The "sort by" option is now more obvious, and the "More" button has been converted to a more recognizable visual trigger (ellipsis).</p>

			<h2>Problem: Folders are useful, but inconvenient to navigate</h2>
			<img><a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=9lbhq0" target="_blank"><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/9lbhq0.jpg" border="0" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a></img>
			<p>Folders display inconsistently - why does a get-link graphic appear for one ("LinkedIn Profile") but not the other ("Woo!")? Additionally, there is no way to preview the specific contents of each folder- a new page has to be launched instead.</p>
			<h3>my Solution</h3>
			<img><a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=11txwer" target="_blank"><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/11txwer.gif" border="0" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a></img>
			<p>I made the icons consistent, allowing users to link to both folders. Most of the details are consistent with the original design, but I added a dropdown arrow in the bottom right corner of each folder row. When clicked, the arrow would expand a list of the folders' contents, which would then be editable, consistent with the normal list view.</p>
